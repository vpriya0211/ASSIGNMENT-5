# Challenge 1: Square Numbers and Return Their Sum
#Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method.
#Task 1: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z. 
#Task 2: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    def sqSum(self):
        return self.x**2 + self.y**2 + self.z**2

point_instance = Point(1, 3, 5)
result = point_instance.sqSum()
print(result)
